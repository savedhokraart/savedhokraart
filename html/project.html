<p><b>Problem statement :</b> People are unaware of the traditional art of Dhokra and even if they are aware of it they find it difficult to buy as the prices are increased by the middle man. Due to this Dhokra artists are facing huge losses as there is no one to buy them and they are finding alternative jobs. This has caused the art to be at the line of extinction.
<br>


<br>
<b>Our solution / Aim of project : </b>To create a smart system which can identify the people who are interested in artistic things and notify them about the Dhokra art. The notification consists of some images of fine Dhokra art and link to the main webpage. The main webpage consists the different available Dhokra art and contact details of the maker. It also uses augmented  reality to  place the art in their house giving them more clarity about the product they are buying.  This prevents the role of middle man which indeed increases the prices which results people not buying it.
<br>


<br>
<b>Problem Scoping : </b>
<br>
Stakeholders: People who are unaware of Dhokra art and the Dhokra artists 
<br>
Information about stakeholders: people who are artistic in nature and like collecting traditional artifacts  
<br>
What is the problem: Lack of awareness and role of middle man in hike in price   
<br>
How do you know it is a problem: Studies have shown that most of the people do not know about the Dhokra art and the Dhokra artists are shifting to other jobs due to lack of customers  
<br>
How could the situation can be improved: By bringing awareness about Dhokra art and creating a platform where they can directly interact with the artists to buy them, hence  increasing their sales.
<br>



<br>
<b>Data Acquisition:</b>
<br>
The data about the person can be collected in the following ways:<br>
•	Chats in Social media <br>
•	Browsing and search history<br>
•	Surveys <br>
•	Camera and photos
 <br>



<br>
<b>Data exploration:</b><br>
The collected data is then cleaned, visualized,   summarized and then simplifies the data acquired. <br>

According to our research most of the Dhokra artists are looking for new job since there are very less people who are buying them. It is so as most of the people are not aware of the traditional Dhokra art and even if they are aware the prices are hiked by the middle man reducing the sales drastically.   
<br>


<br>
<b>Modeling:</b><br>
This software uses learning based approach where it uses AI and makes its own decisions. The model is unsupervised and clusters the data according to the interest and taste of the person. The model also uses computer vision to scan the type of artifact needed by them , uses deep leaning, and uses NLP(natural language processing ) to convert the voice messages and text data from the social media , search history and other means into understandable computer language.
<br>


<br>
<b>Evaluation:</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>How the system works :</b><br>
•	The data is collected from the people <br>
•	If the data shows that the person is interested in artistic things or collections ; a message is sent to the person with some fine Dhokra art images and a link to the main webpage <br>
•	The main webpage consists all the available Dhokra art in stock and is a platform where they can use augmented reality to  place the artifact in the place they want for better clarity before buying<br>
•	If the person wants to buy it, the person can directly contact the artists by the number provided and place an order<br>
•	After the order is placed a bill is generated which could be paid through online mode and instruction details to maintain the artifact 
<br>


<br>
<b>Advantages of the system :</b><br>
•	Is artificially intelligent <br>
•	Uses AR which gives people clarity of what they are buying and where to place it<br>
•	No role of middle man which reduces the cost <br>
•	Easy platform for artists to sell and customers to buy<br>
•	Gives suggestions regularly on taking care of the art<br>
•	Promotes Dhokra artists to continue their art and tradition<br>
•	Prevents the Dhokra art from extinction<br>
•	Creates a worldwide market for Dhokra art<br>
